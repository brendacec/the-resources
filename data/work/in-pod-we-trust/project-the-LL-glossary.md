**Description**

We will be working on the LLUF Glossary, defining terms and objects relevant to the learning lab and helping people identify their purpose and how to use them.

**Rationale**

This project will provide a toolkit for LLUF folks to quickly inform themselves about topics, processes, and objects they might use or come into contact with, helping smooth the work of the Learning Lab. The glossary will offer a reference or starting point for someone who is unfamiliar with the topic/physical space/Learning Lab in general.



**Done**

We have defined our Pod Project with Marlon. More to come.

*Starting Glossary:*

-   Warm and cool colors in a narrative

-   What is a color correction wheel?

-   Lift

-   Gamma

-   Gain

-   Color temperature

-   HSL/HSV/HSB vs RGB

-   Vectorscope

-   Waveform monitor

-   Color curves

-   Lenses (ex. Portrait lenses)

-   Editing (saturation, tint)

One glossary term is on the way: converting a YouTube video to an MP4!

**Doing**

This week, we’ll come up with a list of 30+ terms/tasks that we’d like to include, and then sort them into categories so that someone flipping through the binder can easily find what they are looking for. Starting next week, we’ll take high-quality photos of each item. Inevitably, some of the words that we originally come up with won’t end up in the final glossary, but we’ll try to be discerning about which ones are most useful! After editing the photos, the last step would be writing up the descriptions. By November 21st, we will have 20 terms glossaried (our goal will be to complete three terms a week each). We will then continue through December 19, adding as much as we can.

**Community**

It would be helpful if others suggested terms and objects for us to define as we move forward, whether those are items they were initially unsure about or words they think would benefit the community to make more widely understood.

A binder with an index and a reference page for all of the terms we have defined. A dictionary of the Learning Lab, if you will!
