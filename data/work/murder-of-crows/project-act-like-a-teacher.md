**Description**


The project I’m working on is going to be a spinoff of what Marlon asked me to do a few weeks ago for interaction lab, which was skim through texts about acting and find passages applicable to teaching. My goal is to ultimately create a sort of manifesto for ways we can take acting theory and apply it to the classroom, with regard to three general overarching topics: the teaching persona, the class environment, and teaching moves.


**Rationale**

I think there seems to be a shocking gap in literature crossover between theater and teaching, and I do both of these things pretty often, so it’s thrilling for me to figure out a way to forge them into one more overlapping topic and then be able to demonstrate this overlap to other educators/theater makers. This could help to improve best practices in classrooms for teachers who are struggling to find their footing in a new teaching space, and make teaching feel like a more creative/collaborative growth process, rather than having the onus on the teacher to immediately know exactly what they should do when placed in front of students.

**Done**

Excerpts from 3-4 texts which share a common thread
- Teaching Persona: Acting (method) and Teaching
  - Respect for Acting - Uta Hagen
    - Pg. 4.2 (perception of teaching)
    - Pg. 19.3 (teaching as a communal effort)
    - Pg. 25 (teacher persona)
  - An Actor Prepares - Constantin Stanislavski
  - The Actor and the Target - Declan Donnellan
  - The Viewpoints Book - Anne Bogart
    - Pgs. 7-13 (usage of classroom space)
    - pg . 18.3 (collaboration in the classroom)
  - Teaching Moves: Teaching and Playing
    - The Aesthetic of Play - Brian Upton
    - Small Teaching - James M. Lang
  - Classroom Environment: Improv/Creative Activities for Teachers
    - The Creativity Challenge - Tanner Christensen
    - Improvisation for the Theater - Viola Spolin
    - Games for Actors and Non-Actors - Augusto Boal

**Doing**


There’s a good amount left to do and I’m afraid I’ll need to hold off a bit longer until my show goes up to really schedule some chunk amounts of time at the LL to dive in deep to this project, but I’m super excited for it. After November 17th, I’ll be able to come more frequently to the LL, but until then I’m really feeling a lot of pressure from other areas in my life :( and I need to make sure I can keep all my balls in the air.

**Community**

For right now I’ll have to collect all the materials, and then maybe later in the game something that could be fun would be holding mini-workshops with people to generate more ideas for my texts and how they connect to teaching, or hearing people reflect on the connections I’ll be thinking about.

Definitely people can pick up with helping me compile excerpts or helping me learn inDesign or illustrator!!


**Gallery**

I’d like to make a summary handout using inDesign or Adobe Illustrator, neither of which I have all too much experience with, so it will give me a chance to get familiar with one (or both!) of these new mediums.
