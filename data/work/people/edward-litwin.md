# EDWARD LITWIN
Hey, I’m Edward! I graduated from the college this past spring with a degree in Human
Evolutionary Biology and I’m interested in making education more accessible in part through
sustainable communication of information. My focus is on improving understanding of publicly
divisive topics like vaccine safety and human evolution. I’m especially interested in alternative
and creative approaches to education and optimizing idea presentation within those
approaches. I have a background in biology, history, theater, and game design and
optimization. I’d love to learn more about making videos and graphic design!
