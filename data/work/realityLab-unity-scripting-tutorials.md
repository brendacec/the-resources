A series of tutorials and resources around learning to write C# scripts for the Unity game engine that let you make cool things happen in your game/project.

These tutorials are modular - they can be pursued in any order. Below is merely a suggested sequence for the indecisive uninitiated!

## Basic UI Tutorials

**[Tiniest World.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HICcZzxWDP6cL9Y6xMmYOgyY1Ym7-_HHbYp5XHS6zbQ/edit?usp=sharing)**  Get your first, tiny Unity world up and running in no time!
 
**[Castle in the  Sky.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14N5oHBaOSE&feature=youtu.be)**  Build a Unity scene fit for a monarch while getting a tour of the user interface and learning basic transform tools, camera manipulation, and how to add objects.

## Printing Messages
Learn how to print messages to the console using three common forms of input. Useful for debugging, and as a first step / foundation for most other scripts.

**[Print Message on Keyboard Press & Mouse Click.](https://youtu.be/2Vdnk1WNIHI)** Get Unity to send you a message whenever you press a key on the keyboard or click the mouse. 

**Print Message on Collision with Object.** Get Unity to send you a message whenever your controller runs into an object in the game world.

## Coding Other Outputs
Learn how to code outputs other than message printing.
