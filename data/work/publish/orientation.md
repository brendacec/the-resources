> This semester at the Learning Lab I would like to develop skills that would be assets to me in my pursuit of a career in print publishing.

The following are some ideas that were proposed to this end during my brainstorming session with Marlon and Jordan, all of which can fall under the umbrella of *telling the story* of the Learning Lab: 

**1.** **Weekly Top 10--** celebrating the cutest, kookiest, most marketable, most significant happenings of the week, curated with media and catchphrases
**2.** **Event-based cataloguing--** following a certain class throughout the semester, perhaps, or picking up various labs and events as available
**3.** **Macro-collecting--** creating a larger narrative of **cohesion** which unites all the many wonderful things happening under the Learning Lab's roof
**4. Reading lab curation--** finding some thought-provokin' stuff

Some ideas of my own include the following: 

 **1.** **Developing** a sort of **print media magazine** that collects and
    highlights the various forces at work in the Lab, as well as the
    human faces behind them--could include recurring columns, like
    magazines have advice columns or who-wore-it-betters (although this
    one would obviously take an axe to that spirit of competition)..
    there could be profiles on the various workers of the Learning Lab
    and their internal and external goals but also more in-depth pieces
    on the philosophical underpinnings of the Lab or case-study type
    pieces which illustrate those underpinnings in application and
    action.
 **2.** **Editing** the various **guides** created by LLUFs in their explication of different media projects and forms--for example the "personality graphic" instruction piece, which I had trouble following last week--this would require me to gain at least a basic understanding of the requisite skills for each mission and discern how best to present the challenge to maximize clarity but still leave space for exploration and self-direction, so that learning is accomplished, rather than spoonfeeding.

I am happy to pursue any of these paths, as time would allow. Since I sharpen my analytical/editorial skills in my academic coursework, it would be cool to take a broom to the dusty business-mind in me--or, to isolate the desired skill, to work on selecting and tailoring media to certain goals and audiences (kind of like developing a lesson plan, I guess).  I would like to learn how to advocate for my own ideas and abilities, as well as the importance of the work I am doing.
