**Description**

Our plan is to find a way to scrub LL video files for audio peaks, and turn those moments into GIFs, through a program (command line, JS, etc.). Those GIFs could then automatically be uploaded to an Express App for everyone to enjoy!


**Rationale**

This will make GIF creation much easier, and provide us all with lots of comedic LL content! Implementing it could be a great Pod Challenge down the line.

**Done**


Learned how to trim & split audio from video files in the command line, ad gauged audio stats from that file.


**Doing**


Working on a JS/Python function to read and record moments of peak audio.


**Community**


I would love any and all info on analyzing audio in the command line/JS!


**Gallery**


It may be ambitious, but I would love to display a completed version of this project (a screen recording of the process of uploading a video & it outputting a GIF)! I could then make a doc explaining the basic steps that occur during the process shown in the video.
