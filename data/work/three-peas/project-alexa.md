**Description**


The plan is to use Alexa devices / Amazon’s AI to help speed up processes within the LL and make them more convenient. This includes using code to allow Alexa to upload items to slack, retrieve information from airtable, and even connect to local devices so that we can control some camera settings using our voices in real-time!


**Rationale**

This project is meant to make information about LL projects more accessible, as well as make the LL more user-friendly. For a course toying with AI (e.g. CS50), this project can not only simplify complex topics, but also help students design their own commands for a course/daily life.

**Done**

We set up several Alexa devices, giving each of them distinct names and creating basic custom commands for each of them individually.

**Doing**


Working on linking Alexa devices to other devices (lights) and setting custom commands in order to control devices specific to the LL with our voices. E.g. “Alexa, show everyone where our cards are!” (for which a light would turn on, illuminating the cards on shelves).

We would like to see if Alexa is being responsive to different phrasing as well as to different accents/voices.

For anyone excited about jumping in on this project,  visit this link and try to summarize your takeaways. This article is pretty detailed and we would love it if someone could help provide us with their insights on such a project!

**Gallery**

We can easily demonstrate the commands we’ve created with Alexa by having her right there. Since the commands we’re building are directly affecting the way the Learning Lab runs, it will be helpful showing visitors in the gallery firsthand how Alexa can be a helpful member of the space. Practically, we might have to demonstrate this in the fireplace room or elsewhere, so that the background noise is minimal.
