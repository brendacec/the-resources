# adding to show your work

We'd love you to work in public this year, sharing your ideas even in their development stages. To accomplish this, we've created a little route on [show.learninglab.xyz](https://show.learninglab.xyz) that will serve up markdown files that are stored in the [gitub repo]([https://github.com/mkuzmick/the-show/tree/master/data/work](https://github.com/mkuzmick/the-show/tree/master/data/work).

1. open [stackedit.io]([https://stackedit.io/app#](https://stackedit.io/app#)) on your machine.
