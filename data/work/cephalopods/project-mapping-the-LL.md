**Description**

We are mapping the LL-- and all the ways in which it works. The fluidity of the space as well as the diversity of people and activities makes for a chaotic idea.

**Rationale**

Maps also have different uses throughout history and as a teaching tool -- what information is conveyed by a map? Can we make a 3D topological map of the learning lap

grid cells are responsible for what’s known as path integration, the process by which a person can keep track of where she is in space — how far she has traveled from some starting point, and in which direction — while, say, blindfolded.


**Done**

We have discussed and tried outlining what mapping Color in the LL would look like, and how to use existing structures for mapping color to capture the broad range of activities present in the LL. We concluded that a color wheel with saturation (white in the center) might be an interesting way to capture the highly-saturated physicality of the LL while the white center, radiating outwards, represents the various digital activities of the LL. The physical meets and mingles with the digital, but they form a spectrum of activities.

**Doing**

Color mapping to be worked on the weeks of Nov 8th? LL mapping ideas by end of November?

**Gallery**

The maps, summarized on the board, would make a great contribution to the gallery, and a timelapse of us setting up these different maps may be a fun thing to project as well--like the “Making of” video.
