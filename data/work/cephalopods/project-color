**Description**

Taking the form of 1 workshop and one or more asynchronous activities, the LLUFs will be eased into creating their own pod palette, through a discussion of what is important in palette creation and emotional ties to color, followed by a more lecture-style lesson on the color wheel and different color systems.


**Rationale**

This project aims to teach the LLUFs some color theory and help them apply this knowledge in the creation of a thematic color palette for their pod, as well as contribute to the nascent LL color palette. Though this project does vaguely tie in to the color mapping of the LL--as well as mapping of the LL in general--this lab workshop, to be held from 12 to 1 in the LL on October 25th also hopes to teach students valuable skills in image editing and recognizing what is “off” in photos with regards to color. This will lead to more intentional editing of color in images as well as more informed understanding of what CMYK and other terms actually mean.


**Done**

I have made some sample palettes using each of the platforms I will recommend to the LLUFs, and I compiled a google document of color information. We’ve also discussed as a pod what this workshop should look like, as well as an outline of the workshop. Furthermore, I talked with Marlon about giving him some time to engage the LLUFs with the split in a color matching challenge. :)

Thinking more about what all needs to be prepared for Friday, if any photos should be printed, or anything else (Due date: Friday, October 25th). I also will collect some photos from the internet for the asynchronous activity which will have students identifying what is wrong with an image, color-wise, and I hope to do this by next Friday, November 1st. I will also try to abbreviate the color workshop into a palette building mission, if this is of interest to the team! After the workshop, I will collect and document the progress we made and try to tie this in to our color mapping project. :) I will need to talk to Marlon or Jordan about the Indesign/pinterest--how do I make something that will work in the way we need it to?


**Doing**

this is from JK: Maybe write up a brief report on how it went, including images of stickers and printed out stickers somewhere for people to grab? Also, gather feedback from LL folks who attended the workshop.

**Community**

I will need Marlon’s help on Friday to host the actual workshop, specifically the technical challenge, and I would love feedback after the workshop on how it went and how people want to see this line of work to continue.


**Gallery**

The numerous palettes people have made, perhaps put in different contexts in a pod-centric way, as well as the different interpretations of the LLUF palette exercise. I want to put all these palettes to use in a spread of images that try to capture the LL--perhaps to feed in to the mapping project!

this is from JK: maybe we can go ahead and create a mini gallery tp show off this work?! (See above suggestion)
