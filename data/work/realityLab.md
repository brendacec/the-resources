## UPDATES
As the lab progresses, our meeting notes will appear here.

### MEETING 20191007


This Week, We Will:

#### Refocus our tutorialing on the input-oriented series!

3 lab members will be taking point on creating code and shooting scripts for this series of tutorials (one on keyboard input, one on mouse input, and the other on some sort of proximity trigger or collision trigger).

  

#### Share visually what we’re up to!

Post screenshots and stuff to the realityLab Slack channel! Hang up diagrams and stuff on the whiteboards in the Lab! This is part of a Lab-wide push this week to share our work and make it visible to other folks working in and visiting the Lab. Even stuff that’s work in progress could be very cool! If nothing else, let me (Ceci) know what you’re up to this week.

  

#### In the Not-So-Distant Future:
