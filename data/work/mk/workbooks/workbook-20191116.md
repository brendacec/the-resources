## PROJECTS


### the-tools additions

- need something in the new slack app builder kit
- and need to leverage some of the airtable goodness
- `mk start` script that
	- pulls and pushes `the-show` and `the-tools`
	- opens each in atom
	- opens today's workbook in FoldingText and Marked 2
	- opens today's secret-workbook in nvalt
	- gets the right set of terminal windows open with the right repositories open
	- open specific links in chrome? or should this be handled in chrome?
- `mk show-work` or some such that gets s3 links and a descript into some sort of timeline
	- this week for instance
		- blender
		- code
		- writing
		- prompts
		- photos
		- videos

### particle sims in blender.

start with [this simple one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bv973aqx-w).

then maybe go on to try for the bok snowglobe idea?

### BUILD A RENDER FARM:

more involved
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNhUnPWzVaw

simple way = moby from within Blender itself

cli
`blender -b /path/blender/Video.blend -o /path/video/filename-###### -F MOVIE -x 1 -t 0 -s 0 -e 79972 -a`


I use a command like this on slave 1:
```
blender -b /full/path/Project.blend -o /fully-mapped-network-path/imageName-##### -F PNG -x 1 -t 0 -s 0 -e 40000 -a
```
and slave 2:
```
blender -b /full/path/Project.blend -o /fully-mapped-network-path/imageName-##### -F PNG -x 1 -t 0 -s 40001 -e 80000 -a

	- you could actually use the actual stuff on s3 too I guess
- on rename add to db?
- or special db-pop script

### UNITY

### ARTS AND EDUCATION

AIE
- if the system for identifying and training artists is broken, why would we rely on the artists it's sending us?
- a single artist in residence puts all your eggs in one basket
- makes art the special domain of the few
- and being a great artist doesn't necessarily make you great at the skills we're looking for in an artist-in-residence . . . when sometimes we only need a minimum of craft or domain-bound-excellence, but a boatload of cross-cutting skills

### hello.learninglab.xyz

- read folder of `.md` files and render these (if filename or title == `req.params.id`, for instance)
- should we scrape folders for .md and even docs and then store these on the server? check for updates each 10 minutes or so? or more frequently? (obviously allow a force update)

Projects

develop group of 5 PCs
overhead plan 2020

### at tools

- the thing is this: there are so so many command line tools
- maybe this should be in a cli version of the scripts? or mk scripts?
	- probably mkScrm2s slack

- define data model for clips
- store clipts is the way to go.  or mk-t ools
- heroku probably on `us-east-1`
- have fallen behind on mern stack business
- what if we have students learn and build react apps just locally, pointing at the secretmusiclab api?
- print musiclab songs?



logic of toolset
- mk
	- print
	- airtable
		- get tasks and print
			- me
			- everyone
			- get as html?
			- write html out to file?
		- add link
		- add task
			- for me
			- for someone else
	- musiclab
	-





shortcut keys to develop memory of
- command + arrows for beginning, end, top, bottom cursor moves (horizontally = line, vertically = doc, so "page")
- option + arrows for word by word moves horizontal

### AIRTABLE PAGES

basically the goal here is to make airtable + express app (or maybe airtable + react?) app that lets us

- create and style custom course sites
- create and style custom links lists for fellows, staff, any individual or group
- quickly assemble sites for activities and presentations
- generate the html and slack it out so that people can then tweak from there
- accept new css rules in?

### elements

- css files
- custom css rules as text?
- templates
- links to s3-hosted resources?
- youtube ids
- youtube urls
- youtube embed code
- width and height for embeds
- in sites page, separate columns for video sizes?
- or does the first or first X get hero size and others small and tiled?
-

### m2s slack

- define data model for clips
- store clips in Airtable
- when m2s is run (maybe with proxy flag) actually get the stuff from s3
	- you could actually use the actual stuff on s3 too I guess
- on rename add to db?
- or special db-pop script
-n Airtable
