- option + arrows for word by word moves horizontal


now-ish
* c
 opt o ele ru for glossary
* more glossary samples
* finish pumpkin poster

later
* maybe think about splitting the `mk` **show (your work)** folder off from the rest, but serve it so as to make this distinction invisible.
* need command line tool for s3 and flickr still uploads sooner rather than later.
	- flickr sdk on npm
	- s3 first?

- script to get photos onto s3 and simultaneously slack and airtable (and prep for gallery display?)
- troubleshoot 6D footage in rename script
- need to do a deep dive on LR [metadata](https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom-classic/help/metadata-basics-actions.html). What does it look like? What can we do with it? Can all of this be airtabled?
- look at Jungmin's doc on [montage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10j-CGJxAibGosBJPzkijOmSXcKigFWGDZRiVBpcbZ8g/edit).

	- `/task "do something"` should be handled . . . even `/task do something`
	- then `/task --kg "do something or other"` and if possible `/task --kg do something or other` too
	- then `/tasklist` with default value of today and tomorrow?
		- or deep dive/links for today and just a list going forward?

## PROJECTS

substance designer for arch viz: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/substance-designer-for-architectural-visualization-2/create-photorealistic-arch-viz-materials-with-substance-designer?u=2194065

### APOLLO, GRAPHQL, ETC

apollo full stack tutorial: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/data-source/
apollo server (next)

### WINTER GALLERY

- writeups
	- gold
	- sam
	- sophie/peakGif
- keep on top of [winter gallery prep doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MYIA9QqrboBmbobXpFR6cmLFi5s-lsnfGb7TOeQQlWc/edit#)

	


### PEAKGIF

through folders with chron
* peak-Gif-per-segment
* parse fcpxml (see that section) to get segments
* then run gif
* logic of peakGif/proxy maker
	* read folders to populate Airtable clips base
	* find Airtable record with proxy and gif = false
	* run proxy
	* run gif
		* including S3 step
	* update Airtable record
	* notify slack
	* fire function again (depending?)
- [ultimately change gifs to video](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/replace-animated-gifs-with-video)
- create the following and save all in folder
	- gif
	- csv
	- mp4 (compressed) of 2 sec
	- mp4 of soundbite (in some cases)--maybe not on s



### RECURSIVE function(file)
through files on synology template
for
* proxy
* peakGif
* shoot-probe (to-Airtable)

### FCPXML PARSER
need a data model for data coming from fcpxml
	* clip
		* start-tc
		* end-tc
		* in fcpxml format
		* fcpxml format (not dynamic r number--this we'll generate)
		*
	* library
	* project
	* segment
		* w adjustment data
		* project referenced
		*
	*

### SLACK TO AIRTABLE



### next FULL STACK steps:

animation in react:
https://github.com/react-spring/react-spring
https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion
https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/


gatsby and express together:
- running from a subdirectory: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/path-prefix/
- troubleshooting: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53159814/how-to-link-gatsby-js-with-my-express-server


and don't forget how to graphQL: https://www.howtographql.com/



### the-tools additions

- need something in the new slack app builder kit
- and need to leverage some of the airtable goodness
- `mk start` script that
	- pulls and pushes `the-show` and `the-tools`
	- opens each in atom
	- opens today's workbook in FoldingText and Marked 2
	- opens today's secret-workbook in nvalt
	- gets the right set of terminal windows open with the right repositories open
	- open specific links in chrome? or should this be handled in chrome?
- `mk show-work` or some such that gets s3 links and a descript into some sort of timeline
	- this week for instance
		- blender
		- code
		- writing
		- prompts
		- photos
		- videos
		-

### PRESENTATION WITH ALPHA TESTERS
work on [Emmy's doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fU8DT-qPMeo6q8zwZ9eIB6Np-1tbIyfr7aS9qC9fITM/edit?usp=sharing), making sure to find some way to provide a little rationale for multimodal/multimedia assignments.

### THE TOOLSthe toolsTHE TOOLS
all the things we need. and some we don't.

#### theWorkflow
- live logs and data feeds,
- initial deliverables,
- airtable and schedules,
- advanced deliverables,
- views,
- curation,
- auto-edits

#### slack2airtable
- assign tasks to arbitrary person

####  m2s

- define data model for clips
- store clips in Airtable
- store stills in Airtable
- grab auto-gifs
- when m2s is run (maybe with proxy flag) actually get the stuff from s3
	- you could actually use the actual stuff on s3 too I guess
- on rename add to db?
- or special db-pop script
-

### FCPXML AND WORKFLOW CODE PUBLICATION

- do a series of tutorials on fcpxml
\-
- fcpxml research

### UNITY

https://learn.unity.com/project/creator-kit-beginner-code

### ARTS AND EDUCATION

AIE
- if the system for identifying and training artists is broken, why would we rely on the artists it's sending us?
- a single artist in residence puts all your eggs in one basket
- makes art the special domain of the few
- and being a great artist doesn't necessarily make you great at the skills we're looking for in an artist-in-residence . . . when sometimes we only need a minimum of craft or domain-bound-excellence, but a boatload of cross-cutting skills

### UX DESIGN

### BUILD AN ATOM PLUGIN


https://github.blog/2016-08-19-building-your-first-atom-plugin/

### hello.learninglab.xyz

- read folder of `.md` files and render these (if filename or title == `req.params.id`, for instance)
- should we scrape folders for .md and even docs and then store these on the server? check for updates each 10 minutes or so? or more frequently? (obviously allow a force update)


### at tools

- the thing is this: there are so so many command line tools
- maybe this should be in a cli version of the scripts? or mk scripts?
	- probably mkScrm2s slack

- define data model for clips
- store clipts is the way to go.  or mk-t ools
- heroku probably on `us-east-1`
- have fallen behind on mern stack business
- what if we have students learn and build react apps just locally, pointing at the secretmusiclab api?
- print musiclab songs?



logic of toolset
- mk
	- print
	- airtable
		- get tasks and print
			- me
			- everyone
			- get as html?
			- write html out to file?
		- add link
		- add task
			- for me
			- for someone else
	- musiclab
	-





### AIRTABLE PAGES

basically the goal here is to make airtable + express app (or maybe airtable + react?) app that lets us

- create and style custom course sites
- create and style custom links lists for fellows, staff, any individual or group
- quickly assemble sites for activities and presentations
- generate the html and slack it out so that people can then tweak from there
- accept new css rules in?

### elements

- css files
- custom css rules as text?
- templates
- links to s3-hosted resources?
- youtube ids
- youtube urls
- youtube embed code
- width and height for embeds
- in sites page, separate columns for video sizes?
- or does the first or first X get hero size and others small and tiled?
-

### m2s slack

- define data model for clips
- store clips in Airtable
- when m2s is run (maybe with proxy flag) actually get the stuff from s3
	- you could actually use the actual stuff on s3 too I guess
- on rename add to db?
- or special db-pop script
-n Airtable
