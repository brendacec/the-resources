https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNhUnPWzVaw

simple way = moby from within Blender itself

cli
`blender -b /path/blender/Video.blend -o /path/video/filename-###### -F MOVIE -x 1 -t 0 -s 0 -e 79972 -a`


I use a command like this on slave 1:
```
blender -b /full/path/Project.blend -o /fully-mapped-network-path/imageName-##### -F PNG -x 1 -t 0 -s 0 -e 40000 -a
```
and slave 2:
```
blender -b /full/path/Project.blend -o /fully-mapped-network-path/imageName-##### -F PNG -x 1 -t 0 -s 40001 -e 80000 -a
```

- don't forget to make a list of all the photos that get uploaded with the `boom` script.
- jsdoc maybe? https://jsdoc.app/about-getting-started.html
- need to get content of writestream into variable, so need to promisify it.

		```
		function streamToString (stream) {
		  const chunks = []
		  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
		    stream.on('data', chunk => chunks.push(chunk))
		    stream.on('error', reject)
		    stream.on('end', () => resolve(Buffer.concat(chunks).toString('utf8')))
		  })
		}

		const result = await streamToString(stream)
		```
