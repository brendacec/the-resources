### ARTS AND EDUCATION

AIE
- if the system for identifying and training artists is broken, why would we rely on the artists it's sending us?
- a single artist in residence puts all your eggs in one basket
- makes art the special domain of the few
- and being a great artist doesn't necessarily make you great at the skills we're looking for in an artist-in-residence . . . when sometimes we only need a minimum of craft or domain-bound-excellence, but a boatload of cross-cutting skills

- read folder of `.md` files and render these (if filename or title == `req.params.id`, for instance)
