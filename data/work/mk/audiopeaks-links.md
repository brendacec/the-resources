[bbc/peaks.js](https://github.com/bbc/peaks.js/blob/master/README.md)

A client-side JavaScript component to display and interact with audio waveforms in the browser 

Peaks.js was developed by BBC R&D to allow users to make accurate clippings of audio content in the browser, using a backend API that serves the waveform data.
Peaks.js uses the HTML canvas element to display the waveform at different zoom levels, and has configuration options to allow you to customise the waveform views. Peaks.js allows users to interact with the waveform views, including zooming and scrolling, and creating point or segment markers that denote content to be clipped or for reference, e.g., distinguishing music from speech or identifying different music tracks.

[GitHub - bbc/audiowaveform: C++ program to generate waveform data and render waveform images from audio files](https://github.com/bbc/audiowaveform)

**audiowaveform** is a C++ command-line application that generates waveform data from either MP3, WAV, FLAC, or Ogg Vorbis format audio files. Waveform data can be used to produce a visual rendering of the audio, similar in appearance to audio editing applications.

Waveform data files are saved in either binary format (.dat) or JSON (.json). Given an input waveform data file, audiowaveform can also render the audio waveform as a PNG image at a given time offset and zoom level.
