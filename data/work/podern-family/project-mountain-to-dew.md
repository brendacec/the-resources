# Mountain To Dew
## Kathryn

**Description**
The goal of this project is to digitize the Learning Lab Mountain, a centralized dashboard for all projects, Scavenger Hunts, and other to-doâ€™s, as well as skill-building exercises. Ideally, beyond basic functionality, we could also integrate some 3D modeling into making it a virtual experience and simulate as much actual climbing/overhead touring as possible. The more video-game-like the better!

**Rationale**
This could be especially useful to new LL Fellows as they achieve proficiency in one/two mediums, and also serve as a customizable experience for anyone looking to learn something new. This could also serve as an extension of the RealityLAb project on modeling the LL; it would be even cooler if we could somehow build a customized 3D landscape for each new iteration/learning path.

**Done**
Just getting started on tutorials for Blender! Doing research in and outside of class on building webpages.

**Doing**

**Community**
Would love feedback on how closely this aligns with the intended vision for this project, what could make it most user-friendly and useful to the most people, whether at or outside the Learning Lab, and any other ideas for what software I should pick up this and next week to achieve the basic goals!
Anywhere - if you want to contribute or have ideas for resources to reference or anything else, please let me know!

Hopefully, the completed, interactive site!
