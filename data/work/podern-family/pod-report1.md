# Season 1 Episode 1: Pilot

## We finally found our family! 

### This week, we have been focusing on finding our lives' journeys. 


***Juliana*** is learning 3D Modelling! She's familiarizing herself with the Blender interface by rendering a three-dimensional model of a donut with sprinkles. Marlon has asked her to render a poly-mountain scene to go with one of the Bok Center's backdrops. She's also joined the Bok Center's realityLab asset project. She'll be watching tutorials as well.

***Kathryn*** is getting started with realityLab on the 3D modeling side, but is also considering learning C# to get more involved in building additional Unity functionality for upcoming classes. She's catching up on tutorials this week until the next realityLab meeting, and is also looking into combining visualizations and modeling into building a Learning Lab website (and possibly a personal site too!). 


***Nicole*** is deciding what project she wants to work on that's more specific than "coding", but is currently considering various projects with the unity tutorials, d3, and a virtualized mountain range for the Learning Lab! She's going to work with reality-lab and code-lab, so hopefully some inspiration will come from there too!

***Molly*** and ***Sarah*** are out this week, but tune in next time for more updates on their ends!
