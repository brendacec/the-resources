# WORD GIRL VS. THE TECH WORLD

## Molly
  
**Description**
This semester at the Learning Lab I am taking my first ever deep-dive into developing tech/media skills. I will be working with coding, Ableton, C4D, all of which are completely new to me, with an emphasis on the interaction between interfaces, including those I am already more familiar with, such as Photoshop and Illustrator. My goal is to explore the creative and academic potential between new and developing media and the study of English, which is my field of study at Harvard. This is my attempt to break down the close-minded dichotomy which has been entrenched in me, splitting the two halves of my brain, pitting the humanities against tech.

**Rationale**
This is important because it’s not just about my own skill base, but about my own biases, which are reflective of biases pervasive within the Harvard community and beyond. I believe this sort of bias is precisely what the Learning Lab seeks to unpack and overcome. I want to adapt and grow alongside my passions, which many believe to be imminently irrelevant. I disagree with this projection, and hope the Learning Lab can help me--and I can help the Learning Lab--figure out how to change with the times while still preserving the values and practices which I find crucially important to the development of an individual’s intellectual and moral character.

**Done**
This is a complete 180 from what I initially planned to focus on this semester, so I don’t have much done yet! But I’ve fiddled around with c4d and completed the c4d challenge and just got started exploring the Ableton interface with David the other day.

  **Doing**
 As for right now, I’m going to work to develop holistic base skills in each of the Learning Lab’s main programs, maybe with eyes to being able to understand/play with the interactions between them in the future. It seems like a lot of really cool digital storytelling can be produced when the artist has a deep understanding of multiple programs.
  
**Community**
For the community element, I have virtually zero coding/supertechytech experience, so if any of the other LLUFs are developing beginner tutorials, I think it would be great if I could be one of the go-to testers! However, I would also like to contribute to the community in a more active way, rather than waiting to be approached, so… please, any ideas as to how this might be possible, send my way!

I’m not sure what exactly I should aim for my semester-end presentation to look like…if you could offer some direction with this, I would be so grateful!
