## Juliana

**Description**
I’m currently working on familiarizing myself with Blender. My immediate goal is to reach a point of proficiency that will allow me to start working on user tutorials. I was thinking of beginning with a simple screen capture video that walks folks through the program interface. This could be paired with a tutorial that focuses on constructing a single object (i.e. a donut and a cup of coffee). These tutorials would naturally progress into larger scenes with multiple different objects. I am particularly interested in character development through Blender, and I hope that as I learn how to do this, I will be able to produce instructive tutorials that reflect that skill acquisition.
**Rationale**
From what I’ve seen, C4D seems like one of the more typical introductions into 3D modelling for LLUFS. I would love to see a similar attention paid to Blender in order to increase its use in the lab, and to diversify the modes of modelling used by fellows. 
**Done**
So far, I have created a donut in Blender and rendered it using Eeevee.
**Doing**
I am currently working on creating a Low Poly Mountain scene, which should be completed within the coming week. Working on both projects has helped me to establish comfort with Blender’s tools, so I should be able to develop a user tutorial within the next two weeks (November 8th at the latest). I hope to have a Low Poly Mountain tutorial and donut tutorial made in the two weeks after this. Once I’ve completed my Low Poly Mountain scene, I would like to move into some basic character development. My end-of-semester product will be at least one original character, developed using Blender’s Grease Pencil function.

Low Poly Mountain Scene

Any sort of support/conversations/tutorials about the design of animated characters and scenes would be welcome. I don’t know yet how the skills derived from character development

on other programs will transfer to Blender specifically, but I would like to get a broad overview of how animated characters are typically developed. Anyone who would like to jump in can start by watching either the tutorials that I will make, the ones all over Youtube, or the ones Ceci and Marlon will be making.

Hopefully whatever character I design within the coming weeks will be what I present during gallery week.
