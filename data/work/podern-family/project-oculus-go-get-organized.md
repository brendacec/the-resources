**Description**
I roughly want to follow the steps in this guide https://medium.com/inborn-experience/how-to-build-an-app-for-the-oculus-go-from-start-to-finish-with-unity-cb72d931ddae to create an app along the lines of a Google Calendar, but more personalizable and interactive

**Rationale**
I feel like people trying to make VR/AR apps and/or unity tend to stick with games, and that ends up bringing in a lot of extra variables that can be overwhelming for someone just beginning to learn from scratch. I’m hoping by working through something a bit simpler but more likely to be used by me will help me actually learn the basics and be able to pass them along

**Done**
I haven’t done much yet other than start reading through the above link and the oculus dev stuff. I definitely want to hit up reality lab here as well as i-labs once their workshops start up!

**Doing**
I want to focus on learning C# right now (I learned a good amount from Codecademy, but definitely need a refresher), and then on the elements of Unity I need to make this project. I’ll follow the link I referenced above otherwise!

**Community**
There’s a whole reality lab going on, so if I can make those meetings or run into someone I’ll hopefully know what questions to ask when I get stuck. I’d love to have someone come to i-lab with me so I don’t go alone :); otherwise if anyone has experience with C# or making non-game displays in unity, I’d love to have them join in.
**Gallery**
I can display the code and display the running simulation :)
