# Season 1 Episode 1: Pilot

## We finally found our family!

### This week, we have been focusing on finding our lives' journeys.


***Juliana*** is learning 3D Modelling! She's familiarizing herself with the Blender interface by rendering a three-dimensional model of a donut with sprinkles. Marlon has asked her to render a poly-mountain scene to go with one of the Bok Center's backdrops. She's also joined the Bok Center's realityLab asset project. She'll be watching tutorials as well.

***Kathryn*** is getting started with realityLab on the 3D modeling side, but is also considering learning C# to get more involved in building additional Unity functionality for upcoming classes. She's catching up on tutorials this week until the next realityLab meeting, and is also looking into combining visualizations and modeling into building a Learning Lab website (and possibly a personal site too!).

***Nicole*** is deciding what project she wants to work on that's more specific than "coding", but is currently considering various projects with the unity tutorials, d3, and a virtualized mountain range for the Learning Lab! She's going to work with reality-lab and code-lab, so hopefully some inspiration will come from there too!

***Molly*** is interested in developing curatorial, photo development, editing, and coding skills at the Learning Lab this semester. She has just begun to develop a personal project which will archive and publish various aspects of the Learning Lab's activities, in the hope of learning more about the various skills relevant to print and media publishing. You'll likely find her engaging with interaction-lab and media-lab, and maybe popping for studio-lab some Wednesday nights.
