## Nicole

**Description**
I am going to try to make new labs for people who have never used d3 to learn how to use d3! Because I am taking 171, I have an idea of what a good curriculum order is, but being on the student side makes it pretty obvious where the downfalls are, especially if someone comes to class never having touched JS before (or, in my case, not having done so in ages)

**Rationale**
This is being developed to serve as labs for those trying to learn d3. It’ll ideally be used by those who want to make even cooler projects in d3 :)

**Done**
I’ve made visualization guides for “what looks good” for the LL, and of course any work in 171. I’m happy to share those if anyone wants to see

**Doing**
The goal is to make at least 1 lab a week for now, until I get to more difficult concepts. I’ll probably have to restructure then, but in the meantime this should be a reasonable goal.

**Community**
Honestly, having someone go through the labs as I make them (preferably someone who does have experience with coding AND someone who doesn’t) so I can see where things are unclear and I can fix them! There is a LOT of material to learn in d3, so if anyone wants to help, we could make a timeline of which labs need to be done later on so we can have one person work on making a lab for a different aspect of d3

**Gallery**
I can display the code and display the running simulation :)
