## Best Example Explorables

### Martin & Juhee

**Description**
Explorables come in all shapes and sizes, but, some are more effective at communicating their subject matter than others. Here, we delve into the design elements, code elements, and UI elements that make them so compelling. 

## Examples:

## Quotes on Design that One Should Keep in Mind For Best User and Learner Experience

#### After reading through 'Designing Interactions' by Bill Moggridge:

1.  ‘In user interface design, a lot of it was by trial and error. We tried a bunch of things and out what did and what didn't work. A lot of it was empirically determined. I kept bringing new stuff in and saying ‘What about this?” and Larry would set up tests so that different people could try it.’

2. A really good question to ask is, “What do people expect? When people say an arrow, which way do they think it will move?”

3. “Oh right!”, I went, “This is what we want. We want everything to be apparent.”

 4. “...the physical design had a perky cuteness that was very appealing”

5. “... something that would be both a tool and a toy, something that was fun to play with as well as as a tool for more serious drawings”
