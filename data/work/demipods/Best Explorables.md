# The Explorable Toolkit of Tomorrow (Now!)

## Best Example Explorables

### Martin & Juhee

**Description**

For our project, we are going to become experts at designing and creating explorable toolkits. In a classroom, explorables can substantially aid student engagement and the learning process. Interactive physical infographics, 3D and 2D models and simulations, augmented reality applications, and web-based interfaces are all resources that can function as explorables. Thus, we want to delve into the creation of explorable toolkits with multiple organized resources that would aid the learning process. To illustrate, a concrete example of an explorable toolkit we could create would be an interactive webpage for a physics class. One of the sub-pages would teach students about mass spectrometry. The page could have a section with introductory background readings; a section with a 3D model of the machinery and setting needed to perform this technique; a section with a set of instructions to derive the relevant formulas needed;  a section with a sample problem with a simulation of the answer; and a visual simulation that allows students to manipulate the variables and visualize the outcome.

The end goal is to make a sort of ‘guide’ to making and incorporating accessible explorables of all types and on potentially making ‘toolkits’ for classes to incorporate into their learning materials.
