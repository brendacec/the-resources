**Description**

For our project, we are going to become experts at designing and creating explorable toolkits. In a classroom, explorables can substantially aid student engagement and the learning process. Interactive physical infographics, 3D and 2D models and simulations, augmented reality applications, and web-based interfaces are all resources that can function as explorables. Thus, we want to delve into the creation of explorable toolkits with multiple organized resources that would aid the learning process. To illustrate, a concrete example of an explorable toolkit we could create would be an interactive webpage for a physics class. One of the sub-pages would teach students about mass spectrometry. The page could have a section with introductory background readings; a section with a 3D model of the machinery and setting needed to perform this technique; a section with a set of instructions to derive the relevant formulas needed;  a section with a sample problem with a simulation of the answer; and a visual simulation that allows students to manipulate the variables and visualize the outcome.

The end goal is to make a sort of ‘guide’ to making and incorporating accessible explorables of all types and on potentially making ‘toolkits’ for classes to incorporate into their learning materials.

**Rationale**

Explorables help students to learn more deeply by broadening the scope of empirical input to more senses. In such ways, students can acquire more robust information not only to be able to understand it,  but also to use it to develop higher-order thinking skills. In addition, explorables can help students develop intrinsic motivators towards knowledge by being engaging and providing flexibility as they have multiple dimensions through which students can acquire data.

Explorables would not only benefit students as they would be more engaged in classes and understand the content better, but they would also benefit teachers as it would aid their teaching process. In a lesson or a lecture, it is ineffective to cram a lot of content without allowing students to transfer the knowledge. Explorables would help students internalize what they are learning by getting input of the same information through multiple dimensions or by seeing the application of the information being taught. Explorables can have, for example, simulations, graphs, pictures, sounds, smells, textures, tastes, instructions, and interactive modules that help students internalize the content that would help them learn more deeply.

Explorable toolkits should be easy to use and readily accessible since the purpose of these is for students to better understand the content they are learning. The explorables should be used in class as well as outside of class. For instance, a teacher can use their explorable toolkit to teach a topic during class and also provide more explorables in the toolkit for students to review and truly understand the content that is being taught.


**Done**

We have made this document outlining a rough plan of action on how we would like to start and continue working on this project.

**Doing**

- By *November 1:*
  - Literature Review on existing forms of explorables: digital and non-digital.
  - Literature review on tactile learning experiences in college and university, rather than just K-12 and how it may be incorporated in courses here.
  - Literature Review in ways to bridge this through Augmented Reality as unlike museums, it is difficult to have permanent physical ‘explorables’ to deal with.

- *November 4th* (pending approval)
  - Reading group on this literature review: November 4th or whatever other day works for the Learning Lab

- *November 5th*:
  - Start designing prototypes of all three types of these explorables:
    - Augmented reality
    - Web-based app
    - Physical/tactile explorable

- By *November 17th:*
  - Have prototypes ready

- November 26th:
  - Make a document outlining the design process and what factors that need to be kept in mind (user interface and experience, various learning styles for various students, etc) as well as include, in a separate section, the skills and techniques needed to make various types of explorables a reality. This would be for the audience of the Learning Labs and content creators.
  - Provide our own documentation as well as well documented and articulated lit review on the need of such explorables for the audience of professors. With examples and with possible prototypes.


**Community**

After we do a literature review on existing forms of explorables: digital and non-digital, on tactile learning experiences in college and university, rather than just K-12 and how it may be incorporated in courses here, and on ways to bridge this through Augmented Reality as unlike museums, it is difficult to have permanent physical ‘explorables’ to deal with, we would love to be able to have a reading group to discuss what we find and re-evaluate the importance and feasibility of these types of learning interfaces.


Depending on the stage of the process at that particular point, one can jump into the lit review, the formulation of proper documentation, or even in on the production of the examples or prototypes of the different types of explorables. One could also make an explorable on a topic that particularly interests them personally or even just learn the skills and techniques like design, animation, code, etc involved in making these explorables.


**Gallery**

We would aim to display an example of each type of explorable we make: one based online through a web based interface, one through a more physical and ‘tactile’ interface, and hopefully, one through AR (which would combine the other two types).
