Hey Alexa

A Peas in a Pod Project ft. Marlon

  

-   Started by logging into to LL_Fellows with usual password
    
-   Amazon account already linked to Echo Show and Fire
    

-   Then linked Echo to the same account
    

-   Now have:
    

-   LL_Fellow’s Echo (Wake word “Alexa”)
    
-   LL_Fellow’s Echo Show (wake word “Echo”)
    
-   LL_Fellow’s Fire
    

-   Now to pair two echo buttons to each Echo / Echo show
    

-   Each labelled with the name they belong to
    
-   “Alexa set up my echo buttons”
    

-   Hold button until turns orange
    
-   Release, will turn blue when paired
