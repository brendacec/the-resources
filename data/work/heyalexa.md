# Alexa...

## A Peas in a Pod Project ft. Marlon

1.  Started by logging into to LL_Fellows with usual password
	- Amazon account already linked to Echo Show and Fire
    
3. Then linked Echo to the same account
	-   Now have:
		- LL_Fellow’s Echo (Wake word “Alexa”)
		- LL_Fellow’s Echo Show (wake word “Echo”)
		- LL_Fellow’s Fire

3. Now to pair two echo buttons to each Echo / Echo show
Each labelled with the name they belong to
	 -    
-   “Alexa set up my echo buttons”
	 -    

-   Hold button until turns orange
	 -    
-   Release, will turn blue when paired
