A Peas in a Pod Project ft. Marlon

1.  

-   Started by logging into to LL_Fellows with usual password
    
	-   Amazon account already linked to Echo Show and Fire
    
2.
-   Then linked Echo to the same account
    
	
-   Now have:
	    -

-   LL_Fellow’s Echo (Wake word “Alexa”)
	    -
-   LL_Fellow’s Echo Show (wake word “Echo”)
	    -
-   LL_Fellow’s Fire
    
3.
-   Now to pair two echo buttons to each Echo / Echo show
   
	 - 

-   Each labelled with the name they belong to
	 -    
-   “Alexa set up my echo buttons”
	 -    

-   Hold button until turns orange
	 -    
-   Release, will turn blue when paired
