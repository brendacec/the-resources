**Description**


The YearBOK will be a year-long project to document the happenings and personalities of the people who work in the Learning Lab. It will be in a yearbook/magazine format with spotlights of all members. We will also be spotlighting specific projects executed throughout the year. Finally, we will also be using our skills in InDesign to create stickers and other Bok Center Swag to accompany the YearBOK. This project allows for our pod to learn more about InDesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator.

**Rationale**

- The YearBOK is an opportunity for all pods to be showcased in a *magazine/yearbook form*. Not only will we introduce members of the pods, but we will also be collecting opinions on different learning/learning lab related PODpular opinions. For example, we will have surveys asking whether you are a YOGIBO or a STOOL person, etc.
- The YearBOK will serve as an example of *graphic design* and will demonstrate the *purpose of infographics* in consolidating opinions and biographies. In coming Learning Lab years, future pods will be able to use this YearBOK as a *template* to introduce new pods through a magazine spread and edit it according to that year’s theme.
- For our pod, the YearBOK will allow us each to hone our skills in *InDesign*, *Photoshop*, and *Illustrator* - skills that we learned from Snow throughout the past few weeks.

**Done**

- So far, we have begun learning Adobe InDesign and Illustrator through workshops with our awesome mentor, Snow. We have also started brainstorming various layout templates for our YearBOK, referencing Pinterest for inspiration. In addition, we have started thinking about design elements such as color scheme (using various color scheme generators) and fonts.
- We are currently working on creating a general layout for the PODProfile spreads. To do this, we are beginning with our own pod’s PODProfile. We have begun by cutting out our own [headshots](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CAG_vB0VZ4dwfLUP1N8NIKO1Tnh84Wz9) HERE -- we are hoping to do the same with the other LLUFs’ headshots for their profiles too.
- We have also created a [survey](https://forms.gle/ACYUT1a3NDcxZ3bC9 (found HERE) to send out to all LLUFs in order to gather information about their pods, etc. which we will use in their PODProfiles 

**Doing**


- Our final product for this semester will be part 1 (the first half) of our YearBOK (which we hope to have printed by the end of the school year i.e. May 2020). Part 1 will cover PODProfiles, “Best of Slack” infographics, UnPODpular Opinions, and pod project sPODlights from the fall semester.  
- We have outlined a general timeline for our work on part 1 of the YearBOK below:

    - **Week 1 (10/18):** Choose a template/create our PODProfile spread
    - **Week 2 (10/25):** (1) Finalize our own pod’s PODProfile spread (2) Send out LLUF pod survey (possibly extend to next week)
    - **Week 3 (11/1):** (1) Infographic workshop? (2) Best of Slack/emoji infographic (3) Bump the survey from last week
    - **Week 4 (11/8):** (1) Create UnPODpular Opinions spread (need to figure this out?), (2) start filling in PODProfile templates, (3) ask for other pods’ project info for project sPODlights (another survey?)
    - **Week 5 (11/15):** (1) Work on project sPODlights -- create spread template, (2) continue filling in PODProfile info
    - **Week 6 (11/22):** (1) finish work on sPODlights, (2) start piecing everything together
    - **Week 7 (THANKSGIVING BREAK)**
    - **Week 8 (12/6):** Showcase (first half of the YearBOK i.e. fall semester portion)

**Community**

- The Podashians will be putting up the spreads that we create and will ask the LLUFs for their input on what they like about the design and what could be improved so far. We will ask that they attach notecards to the template that we will be able to read on Fridays.
- The Podashians will be sending out a survey for biographies, headshots, and PODpular opinions.
- If someWorking on linking Alexa devices to other devices (lights) and setting custom commands in order to control devices specific to the LL with our voices. E.g. “Alexa, show everyone where our cards are!” (for which a light would turn on, illuminating the cards on shelves).

We would like to see if Alexa is being responsive to different phrasing as well as to different accents/voices.

For anyone excited about jumping in on this project,  visit this link and try to summarize your takeaways. This article is pretty detailed and we would love it if someone could help provide us with their insights on such a project!

We would like to see if Alexa is being responsive to different phrasing as well as to different accents/voices.

For anyone is excited to pick up/about jumping in ton theis project, they can download the latest spread draft we have on our Pod_Podashians folder and edit it. Alternatively, they could create new template examples that visit this link and try to summarize your takeaways. This article is pretty detailed and we cwould collaborate on later. Finally, they could add to our Pinterest board or slack us Pinterest examples that we could model for future designs.love it if someone could help provide us with their insights on such a project!


**Gallery**

- We will hand out and display BOK STICKERS after printing and cutting out some existing designs,
- In addition, we will also be displaycan easily demonstrate the commands we’ve created with Alexa by having the logo procesr right there. Since the commands we’vre begun with Snow as a precursor for Bok SWAG (sweaters etc.) next semester in order to show what we’ve been doing but to possibly also get feedback.
- Display spreads from our Yearbook up until this point, which according to the current timeline should include our spreads of PODProfiles (of at least our Pod) and a Best of Slack Emoji infographic, and sPODlights (spotlights on projects/labs  LLUFs have done thus far) uilding are directly affecting the way the Learning Lab runs, it will be helpful showing visitors in the gallery firsthand how Alexa can be a helpful member of the space. Practically, we might have to demonstrate this in the fireplace room or elsewhere, so that the background noise is minimal.
