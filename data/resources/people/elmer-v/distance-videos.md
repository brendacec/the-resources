# Distance Lab Update Video(s)!

It has been a while since all of us, the LLUFs, have posted a video to our distance diaries. On the heels of our one-month reflections (which can now be found on [this lovely website](https://spark.adobe.com/page/8TWfFbQofOndK/)), this seems like a perfect time for all of us to post some video updates.

We have several ideas at the moment...

## Shorter Video(s)

### 1. Bok Friends 
Following one of the recent TikTok trends ([seen here](https://www.tiktok.com/@amandaseavers/video/6805981430582234374)), record yourself doing something random/ridiculous and then turn, realize the camera is there, and wave hello...**BUT**, with a Bok twist: 

The "random" thing you are doing should in some way connected to your current learning experience. In other words, perhaps find yourself doing readings in the shower, on a Zoom call while cooking, etc.

### 2. What is Inspiring You?
Record (audio-only) yourself reading a quote that gets you motivated/inspired to do your schoolwork.

### 3. What's in your Fridge?
Following yet another recent TikTok trend ([seen here](https://www.tiktok.com/@calfreezy/video/6811885553479421189)), record yourself taking something random out of your fridge. The Bok twist: 

The "random" item you take out should reflect a tool that you have been using to do your Bok work, such as your laptop open to the Final Cut window, Photoshop, Illustrator, etc. (Note: Does not need to be a laptop) 

## Longer Video

### 1. Reflection
Reflect and answer the following questions: How would you reflect on the purpose of learning? Has this idea changed for you since you have been learning online?
