# Basic strategies for filming stabilized smartphone footage

Chances are, the camera inside your smartphone is very powerful and capable of capturing beautiful and compelling footage. Why then, do many of the videos we record on our phones, end up looking shaky and haphazard?

Perhaps it has to do with a perception that even though our smartphone's camera is powerful and becoming increasingly so with every new model released, that at the end of the day, it's still fundamentally a phone & computer that also has a camera attached.

And as a result of this perception, we may not invest as much time and effort into thinking about how best to execute our shots for the purposes of greater stabilization. (As well, the fact that the camera is so light and easily maneuvered, can contribute to a lack of stability in shots.)

But with all that said, we can do better! With a little research, planning, and decent execution, you can generate brilliant and stable footage using just your body, with objects around your house, and/or perhaps with some affordable gadgets designed for footage stabilization.
